\section{Network protocol and command format}
% Zusammenspiel von Klient und Server
% (Fließtext und Sequenzdiagram, ggf UML-Klassendiagram)
% TODO: JSON verlinken / footnote
% TODO: Alphabet und Escapes genau festlegen
Client and server communicate via a TLS-encrypted WebSocket connection.
This implies that the server must possess a valid certificate.

Requests including one of the commands specified below are encoded as a single
JSON object each and are sent from client to server.
If not specified otherwise, each request produces a single response from the
server, also encoded as a JSON object.
A request or response must always be sent as a single WebSocket message.

The \textbf{cmd} property of the top-level JSON object of a request defines
which command the client is trying to execute.
As such, the \textbf{cmd} property must always be included in a request.
Parameters, return values and error codes are also encoded as properties of
the top-level JSON object of a request or response.

The names of the commands specified below are to be used as the value of the
\textbf{cmd} property.
These are to be encoded as strings.

If an error occurs during command execution, possibly caused by invalid
parameters, the response JSON object consists of only the single integer
property \textbf{error}.
The meaning of these error codes is specified in chapter \ref{sec:errorcodes}.

\section{Data types and restrictions}\label{sec:datatypes}
While JSON itself defines several data types, the property
definitions in the following chapters use the conventional, more restrictive
variants as used, for example, in the Java programming language.
As such, mentions of \code{int} and \code{long} refer to the signed variants
within the upper and lower bounds defined in the Java programming language.

Strings may contain any Unicode symbol as long as it is properly escaped to
match the restrictions set by JSON specifications.

The string properties defined in chapter \ref{sec:descriptions} might impose
additional restrictions, such as maximum amount of characters, i.e. Unicode
symbols, or a reduced set of symbols, e.g. only alphanumeric characters.
In this document, the set of alphanumeric characters is defined to consist
of arabic numbers and lower-case and upper-case letters of the ISO basic Latin
alphabet (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).

Properties of type \code{date} are to be represented as Unix time%
\footnote{\enquote{Unix time}, Wikipedia, Version 822615863,
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unix_time&oldid=822615863}},
and encoded as \code{long}s.

Properties of type \code{decimal degree} must be valid decimal degrees
representing either latitude or longitude and are to be encoded as
\code{double}s.

While JSON supports arrays of different data types, this protocol does not.
All arrays defined here consist of elements of the same type.

\section{Object descriptions}\label{sec:descriptions}
In order to transmit information about domain model objects via JSON encoded
requests and reponses, the encoding of the objects into \enquote{descriptions}
is specified below.

Each object can be encoded as a shallow, complete, or recursively
complete description.
While complete descriptions contain all properties of the object itself and
may be requested from the server via the respective \textbf{get-*-details}
commands, recursively complete descriptions contain the complete descriptions
of certain types of referenced objects, e.g. a recursively complete description
of a usergroup contains recursively complete descriptions of all events and
polls.

Recursively complete descriptions are not transferred in any of the
commands specified in chapter \ref{sec:commands}.
Instead, they are used to generate the checksums contained in shallow
descriptions (see chapter \ref{sec:checksum}).

The commands defined in chapter \ref{sec:commands} might not use all of the
descriptions specified below.
For the sake of consistency, they are listed here anyways.

\section{Updates}
To inform users of changes that affect them, update objects are created with
each successfully executed command that makes changes to domain model objects.

These update objects are divided into several types. All of them hold at least
the following properties:

\apiArgument{
    type/string/Type of the update object{,} see list below,
    time-created/date/Point in time at which this update was created,
    creator/int/ID of the account that caused the creation of this update
}

\updateType{account-change}{
    \apiArgument{
        account/object/Complete description of the account that changed{,}
        omitting all properties that didn't change.
    }
}

\updateType{user-group-change}{
		\apiArgument{
				usergroup/object/Complete description of the user group that changed{,}
				omitting all properties that didn't change.
		}
}

\updateType{event-change}{
		\apiArgument{
				event/object/Complete description of the event that changed{,}
				omitting all properties that didn't change.
		}
}

\updateType{poll-change}{
		\apiArgument{
				poll/object/Complete description of the poll that changed{,}
				omitting all properties that didn't change.
		}
}

\updateType{poll-option-change}{
		\apiArgument{
				pollOption/object/Complete description of the poll option
				that changed{,} omitting all properties that didn't change.
		}
}

\updateType{group-membership-change}{
		\apiArgument{
				membership/object/Complete description of the membership that changed{,}
				omitting all properties that didn't change.
		}
}

\updateType{chat}{
    \apiArgument{
        group-id/int/ID of the group to which the chat message was sent,
        message/string/Content of the message
    }
}

\updateType{position-request}{
		\apiArgument{
				end-time/date/Point in time until which position sharing is requested
		}
}

\updateType{contact-request}{
		\apiArgument{
            -/-/-
		}
}

\updateType{position}{
		\apiArgument{

\section{Checksums for recursively complete descriptions}\label{sec:checksum}
\newcommand{\hashAlg}{MD5}
In order to avoid unnecessary transmissions of complete descriptions, each
object can also be shallowly described.
These shallow descriptions contain checksums of the recursively complete
descriptions of the same object, making it possible to detect whether entire
parts of the access hierarchy are in sync and do not need to be queried again.

\par The \hashAlg~algorithm will be used to calculate the checksums.

\par The following paragraphs specify how to serialize a recursively complete
description into a unambiguous form that can then be used as the input for the
checksum algorithm.

\par \textit{Note: In this paragraph, the digits 0 through 9 do not describe
the ASCII literals \enquote{0} through \enquote{9} with ASCII values 48 through
57 but instead describe the non-printable control characters with values 0
through 9.}\\
Descriptions themselves are treated as objects.
Objects are serialized by adding a 1 to the input, then serializing all
properties and finally adding a 3 to the input.
Object properties are serialized by first sorting them in alphabetical order of
their keys and then serializing their values, adding a 2 as seperator between
each two values.
Arrays are serialized by adding a 4 to the input, then serialiazing all values
in ascending order, seperated by a 5 each, and finally adding a 6 to the input.
In this protocol, arrays can only contain object descriptions or integers.
The ascending order of integers is based on their signed value.
The ascending order of descriptions matches the ascending order of their
included IDs.

Strings are serialized with the same escape sequences as used in
JSON\footnote{Vgl. \enquote{RFC 7159}, Chapter 7 \enquote{Strings},
\url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159}}.
No quotation marks are added arounds strings.
Integers are serialized in decimal form.
Decimal degrees, the only floating-point numbers in this protocol, are
serialized in decimal form, with the same precision as defined in chapter
\ref{sec:datatypes}.
Booleans are serialized as either \enquote{true} or \enquote{false}, in
lowercase and without quotation marks.

% TODO: Update example
\par Example: Checksum generation for an Event with the following details:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{   "type" : "event",
    "id": 2,
    "title": "200k+ DPS or kick",
    "creator": 200,
    "time-start": 1514761200000,
    "time-end": 1515000600000,
    "latitude": 49.011978,
    "longitude": 8.416377,
    "participants": [ 3, 200, 43378 ]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\newcommand*\circled[1]{\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{
            \node[shape=circle,draw,inner sep=1pt] (char) {\scriptsize #1};}}

This event is serialized into the following sequence.
Control characters are represented as \circled{1}, \circled{2}, \circled{3}
etc.\\
\textit{Note: The line-breaks are solely added for better readability and are
not part of the actual sequence.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=norm,firstnumber=1]
(*\circled{1}*)200(*\circled{2}*)2(*\circled{2}*)49.011978(*\circled{2}%
*)8.416377(*\circled{2}*)(*\circled{4}*)3(*\circled{5}*)200(*\circled{5}%
*)43378(*\circled{6}*)(*\circled{2}*)1515000600000(*\circled{2}*)
1514761200000(*\circled{2}*)200k+ DPS or kick(*\circled{2}*)event(*%
\circled{3}*)
\end{lstlisting}

This sequence has the hex-encoded \hashAlg~checksum\
\
\code{5770ff0d6314b111f3006e9a4d6e4884}

\par The following Python script serves as an example implementation of this
algorithm:
